This repository documents my learning path in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
It contains step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks where I implement and practice different algorithms from scratch as well as using scikit-learn.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a personal study log + reference and to help others who are also starting their ML journey.
